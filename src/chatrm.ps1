    .SYNOPSIS
    Find local AI chat transcripts by title or message text.
    .DESCRIPTION
    Searches Claude Code, Copilot Chat and Codex transcripts on this machine and
    returns one object per match, so results can be piped. Also refreshes the
    index that makes chatrm's tab completion instant.
    .PARAMETER Text
    Text to look for in the chat title and the first/last user messages.
    .PARAMETER Provider
    Limit the search: claude, copilot, codex. Defaults to all of them.
    .PARAMETER Deep
    Match anywhere in the transcript rather than title and previews. Slower.
    .PARAMETER All
    Include subagent / workflow transcripts, which are hidden by default.
    .PARAMETER AllProjects
    Search every project rather than the one this directory belongs to.
    .EXAMPLE
    chatfind "brownout"
    .EXAMPLE
    chatfind gitignore -Provider copilot | Select-Object Title, Id, Age

    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
    Delete a local AI chat transcript, permanently.
    .DESCRIPTION
    An id is unambiguous, so it deletes outright. A title can match several
    chats, so those are listed and walked one by one.

    Titles match on substring, so part of a title is a search, not a choice.
    A single match found that way is shown in full and asked about before
    anything goes - and at the prompt, Enter fills the title in the way Tab
    would instead of running, so the whole of it is on screen before a second
    Enter acts on it. A title typed in full deletes as it always did, and
    -Force skips the asking entirely.

    Tab fills in the whole argument - title or id, quoted or not - from the
    index that chatfind keeps warm; run chatindex to rebuild it.
    Also removes what the transcript leaves behind - sidecars, file-history and
    session-env for Claude, chatEditingSessions for Copilot.
    .PARAMETER Target
    One or more ids (prefixes are fine), or a chat title.
    .PARAMETER Provider
    Limit to claude, copilot or codex. Defaults to all of them.
    .PARAMETER Force
    Skip the confirmation prompts in title mode.
    .PARAMETER AllProjects
    Match titles from every project rather than the one this directory belongs
    to. Ids are unambiguous and always reach any project.
    .PARAMETER WaitForIdle
    Wait after deleting until nothing in this project's chats has been written
    for a minute, then say the window is safe to reload. A reload restarts the
    extensions, so one taken mid-answer loses that answer. It blocks the shell
    while it waits; Ctrl+C stops it and deletes nothing back.
    .PARAMETER DropJobs
    A chat with a prompt queued for it by chatq is kept, and the job named.
    -DropJobs drops those jobs first - cancelling one that is running and
    waiting for it to stop - and then deletes.
    .PARAMETER Archive
    Move the chat out of the way instead of deleting it; chatrestore brings it
    back. A Claude chat and its leftovers go to data/archive/, a Codex thread
    through codex archive. Copilot chats have an archive of their own in VS Code.
