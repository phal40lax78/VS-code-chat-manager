function chatinstall {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
    Add this script to your PowerShell profile, so the chat commands are there in
    every new shell. Dot-source the file once, then run chatinstall.
    .DESCRIPTION
    Writes the dot-source line into $PROFILE, creating the profile if there is
    none, and backing it up to $PROFILE.bak first. The script knows where it is,
    so no path has to be typed twice. A line left behind by an older copy is
    replaced rather than left to load nothing - run this again after moving the
    file.
    .PARAMETER Force
    Rewrite the line even when it is already there.
    .PARAMETER NoRestart
    Leave a running watcher and overlay on the copy they run. The VS Code
    extension installs into each PowerShell's profile in turn, and restarts
    them once, after the last.

    .SYNOPSIS
    Take the chat commands back out of your PowerShell profile.
    .DESCRIPTION
    Drops the dot-source line from $PROFILE, backing it up to $PROFILE.bak first,
    and leaves everything else in that file alone. Matches the old filename too,
    so a profile still carrying a deleteLocalChat line is cleaned as well.

    The commands stay defined in the shell you run this from - they are already
    in memory, and nothing can unload them. Close it and they are gone.

    The folder is left on disk by default, data/ and all, since it holds the
    index, the tombstones and any queued prompts. -All deletes it too.
    .PARAMETER All
    Also delete the script's own folder, including data/ and every queued
    prompt in it. Refused while data/archive/ holds archived chats, since
    those are the only copy - chatrestore them first, or add -Force.
    .PARAMETER Force
