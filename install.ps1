# VS-code-chat-manager one-line installer
#
#   iex (irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phal40lax78/VS-code-chat-manager/main/install.ps1)
#
# Downloads the tool - VS-code-chat-manager.ps1 and the src/ folder it loads -
# to a real folder and dot-sources it from there. It has to reach disk first:
# the script finds data/ and the line it writes into $PROFILE from its own file
# path, and the background watcher it starts re-loads the file by that path -
# running it out of memory leaves all three empty.
#
# One zip of the repo, never the files one by one: raw.githubusercontent.com
# caches each file on its own for minutes after a push, so files fetched singly
# can come from two versions - and a loader from one with parts from the other
# fails in ways that point nowhere near the cause. A zip is one commit.
#
# Under iex this runs in the caller's scope, which is the point - the dot-source
# at the end then lands the commands in the session you typed from. That also
# means it must not set $ErrorActionPreference or leave variables behind, and it
# cannot wrap itself in & { }, which would dot-source into a scope about to go.
#
# Set CHAT_MANAGER_DIR beforehand to install somewhere other than
# ~/Tools/VS-code-chat-manager.
