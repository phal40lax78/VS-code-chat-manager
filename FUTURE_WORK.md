# Future work

Open problems and deliberate deferrals. Each says why it waits and what closing
it would take.

## Deliver into a live chat instead of beside it

**Shelved in 0.6.0** in favour of showing the chat fresh: after a headless
run the chat's old process is ended so the next message starts from disk
(spike S29), and the window shows the chat anew - with Reload Webviews
where nothing in it was working, in 0.6.0, and in a tab of its own since
0.7.2. That covers what this was wanted for - a window that shows the run
without a whole reload - while the prompt keeps going through the
headless run, where a permission prompt parks the job, a `CLAUDE.md` edit is
done, and the prompt is yours rather than another session's. The notes below
stay for if a live delivery is wanted again.

**Why deferred:** a chat open in a VS Code window shows a chatq run only after
a reload (since 0.5.0 one the window takes by itself when you are away).
Delivering the prompt into the open chat would show it running, live, with no
reload at all. Claude Code's cross-session messaging can do that; what its
documentation (code.claude.com/docs/en/cross-session-messaging, read
2026-09-23) settles, and what is left to try:

- **On by default** from Claude Code 2.1.234 on native Windows; every session
  binds an inbox (a named pipe on Windows). The page never mentions VS Code,
  but panel sessions here export `CLAUDE_CODE_MESSAGING_SOCKET`, so they have
  one too.
- **No token needs handling.** A `claude -p` session can send with the
  `SendMessage` tool by the target's name, and with `crossSessionInbound`
  unset, a receiver in any prompting mode (default, auto, `acceptEdits`)
  delivers a message from a sender that does not bypass permissions. The
  raw pipe, and its `CLAUDE_CODE_MESSAGING_TOKEN`, is documented only for a
  session's own child processes, so a SessionStart hook copying tokens into
  `data/` is not needed and is not the way.
- **An idle receiver starts a turn** with the message; a busy one reads it
  between tool calls, which chatq's busy check already keeps it from.
- **It arrives as from another session, not from you.** It cannot answer a
  permission prompt, and the receiving Claude is told never to change
  settings, `CLAUDE.md` or other configuration because another session asked
  — so a queued prompt that edits `CLAUDE.md` could be turned down where the
  headless run does it.
- **Permission prompts wait for you** in the panel, where the headless run
  denies and parks the job.

Spike S28 in TESTING.md (2026-09-24) settled the rest: the relay finds a panel
chat by the `name` its `~/.claude/sessions/<pid>.json` entry carries beside
its `sessionId`, the idle chat starts the turn within seconds, live, and does
ordinary work asked this way — but a message has to say to do it *here*, or
it is read as a request to answer the sender. A `CLAUDE.md` edit is declined
in the chat, as the framing says.

**To close:**
1. Send: the target's name from its registry entry; a relay `claude -p
   --safe-mode --tools SendMessage` with the prompt on stdin, never as an
   argument (`--allowedTools` takes a list and swallows a prompt placed after
   it); the message opening with what chatq is and that the work is to be done
   in this chat, not answered to the sender.
2. Detect the turn's end for the `done` alert and the queue: the receiving
   transcript's own records after the delivered message (`origin.kind` is
   `peer`, with its `msg_id`), since `claude agents` does not list VS Code
   sessions. A limit or a 529 in that turn requeues a continue as it does now.
3. A prompt that edits `CLAUDE.md`, settings or other configuration is
   declined there; say so in the alert, or send those headless.
4. Deliver this way only into a chat live and idle in a window; everything
   else stays the headless run it is now.

## Deliver into a live Codex chat through `codex queue`

**Why deferred:** found after v0.1.0.
- **The gap today.** chatq never checks whether a Codex thread is open in a
  VS Code window, and every Codex job goes through `codex exec resume`. An open
  Codex panel then goes stale, like a Claude one, and nothing says so.
- **The official way in.** `codex queue --thread <uuid|exact name> --message
  <text>` is in the bundled codex-cli 0.154.0-alpha. It sends
  `thread/queue/add` to Codex's shared local app-server daemon, as a user
  message. It needs no per-session token, and the message is not framed as
  coming from a peer. Claude's inbox pipe (above) has both problems.
- **It doesn't replace the wait.** It queues at once, so chatq still holds the
  prompt until the reset and only then hands it over.

Open questions, from `codex-rs/tui/src/session_queue_commands.rs`:
- Does the VS Code extension's chat run on that shared daemon? If not, the
  message lands in a thread nobody is looking at.
- With no daemon running, it falls back to an embedded app server. Does the
  turn then run, or is it only recorded?
- An older daemon answers "does not support thread/queue/add", so the method
  may still be experimental.
- There is no `--json` event stream. The outcome would have to be read from the
  thread's rollout file.

**To close:**
1. Spike: with a Codex chat open and idle in the panel, run
   `codex queue --thread <id> --message ok`. Does the panel show it and run it?
   Repeat with VS Code closed.
2. Detect a live Codex thread, through the daemon's thread list or the
   extension's process. Deliver to it with `codex queue`, and use
   `codex exec resume` otherwise.
3. Classify the run from the rollout: after the queued message, tail it until
   the turn completes or errors.

## Attachments: what 0.3.0 left out

`-Attach` and `-Paste` shipped in 0.3.0. What they do not cover yet:

- **`-Paste` off Windows.** The clipboard is read through Windows Forms.
  **Why deferred:** nothing here runs macOS or Linux (see the CI entry below).
  **To close:** `osascript` on macOS (`the clipboard as «class PNGf»`), and
  `wl-paste` / `xclip -selection clipboard -t image/png -o` on Linux, each
  writing the same `clip.png`.
- **A Claude image as a real attachment** rather than a path Claude Code opens
  with its Read tool. **Why deferred:** spike S18 showed the path route works —
  the model sees the picture — so there is nothing to fix yet. The one way in
  would be `--input-format stream-json`, whose user message can carry image
  blocks: a different runner from the byte-exact stdin one every test holds.
  **To close:** only if a run is ever seen to miss an image the path named.
- **Office files.** Neither CLI reads `.docx` or `.xlsx` natively; each would
  need a script to. **To close:** convert them at queue time (to PDF or text)
  if that turns out to be wanted.
- **An image pasted into a prompt tab that is then cancelled** stays in
  `data/queue/`. **Why deferred:** removing what appeared while the tab was
  open would also remove an image pasted at that moment into another shell's
  open tab. **To close:** sweep files in `data/queue/` that no prompt links to
  once they are a day old.

## `liveIdle` default

**Why deferred:** spike S29 showed the side bar keeps a chat's cached view
even once its process is ended, so ending it alone never shows the run; the
window has to show it anew - with Reload Webviews where nothing was
working, in 0.6.0, and in a tab of its own since 0.7.2. Since 0.6.0 the two
settings differ only in when the process goes:
- `warn` (the default) runs, then ends the idle process after the run when
  nobody is at the PC, and on Show it otherwise.
- `stop` ends it before the run, by the same checks
  (`Stop-ChatIdleProcess`), and waits, as for a busy chat, while a workflow
  or background agent is in flight.

Still open: whether a present user's process may be ended at the run's end
too. What a side bar does when the chat on screen loses its process - and
whether an unsent draft survives - has not been watched.

**To close:** S30 item 5 in TESTING.md. If the side bar takes it quietly and
keeps the draft, end it at run end whoever is at the PC, and drop the `live`
case.

## A chat typed into while chatq runs it

**Why deferred:** found on 2026-09-23, after the fix it would need was already
under way. An open panel does not follow a chatq run: a window reloaded
mid-run shows the chat as it stood at that moment, stopped halfway, and
`continue` typed there starts a second agent on the same session while
chatq's is still working. Both edit the same files at once. The panel's agent
knows nothing of what chatq's did after the fork, only the files. chatq checks
for a busy chat before a job starts, and never while it runs. The `started`
alert says nothing about keeping out of the chat.

What 0.6.0 does about it: Show it and the chip leave a chat alone while a
queued prompt or any `claude -p` goes into it (`Show-ChatFresh`, outcome
`running`); the next run into a chat waits 30 s after a request to show it
(`Get-ChatShowHold`); and a run into a chat a window opened while the run went
on is followed by a `ran` request, as for a chat held from before
(`Invoke-ChatqJob`). What is left is someone typing into such a window before
the run ends - a window that opened the chat mid-run, a startup open more
than 30 s after the chip's click, or the side bar's idle process under
`liveIdle: warn`.

**To close:**
1. Say so up front: when the chat is open in a window, the `started` alert
   says not to type in it until `done`.
2. Watch during the run. A record from another entrypoint (`claude-vscode`)
   whose parent is outside the run's own chain is a second writer: alert at
   once, naming the chat.
3. Decide whether chatq then stops its own run or lets both finish. Stopping
   loses less when the two are editing the same files.

## Approve permission prompts from the phone

**Why deferred:** the chosen behaviour is to alert and park.

**To close:** a `--permission-prompt-tool` MCP bridge that pushes an Allow/Deny
alert and waits for the answer with a timeout. Join would reach it through
Tasker, or ntfy through a reply topic. This is Claude only; `codex exec` cannot
ask mid-run.

## The console: what 0.5.0 left out

- **A console on macOS.** **Why deferred:** the Mac panel has never run
  (S24), and a Cocoa window with text entry, drag and drop and a pasteboard
  in untested JXA would only add to that. **To close:** after S24, an
  `NSWindow` from the same host, or the console as a small local web page
  the pwsh host serves on 127.0.0.1.
- **New Codex chats.** + New chat starts Claude chats only. **Why deferred:**
  a new Codex thread's id comes back in `thread.started` rather than being
  given up front, so a retry after a limit could start a second thread.
  **To close:** capture the id from `thread.started` as the run begins, save
  it on the job, and resume it from then on.
- **`chatq -New <folder>` in a shell.** **Why deferred:** the console was
  the ask; `New-ChatqJob -Kind new` does the work already. **To close:** a
  parameter set on `chatq` that calls it, with `-Name`.
- **Changing a waiting job's mode or model** from the console. **Why
  deferred:** only the prompt is editable in place; Remove and send again
  covers the rest. **To close:** the same chips in the details pane, written
  through `Set-ChatqProp`.
- **Answering a permission prompt from the console.** A run that asks is
  parked as needs-input. **Why deferred:** the same as for the phone, above.
  **To close:** the same `--permission-prompt-tool` bridge, answered from
  the console's details pane.
- **Opening the chat in VS Code** from the console. **Why deferred:** the
  console was not in 0.6.0's scope. Since then the way exists: the overlay's
  open chip writes `data/open-request` and the extension opens the chat by
  its id. **To close:** a button in the console's details pane that calls
  `Start-ChatShowFreshProcess` for the picked chat, as the chip does.
- **The reply as it streams.** The console shows a run's reply once the run
  ends. **Why deferred:** reading a log the watcher holds open works now
  (`Get-ChatqLogEntries` shares with the writer), but redrawing the details
  pane every pass costs the window's thread while a long run writes
  megabytes. **To close:** read only what the log grew by since the last
  pass, and append it to the pane rather than redrawing it.
- **Every argument hardened for `claude.cmd`.** An npm install's
  `claude.cmd` runs through cmd.exe, which does not read `\"` as an escape.
  A new chat's `--name` has `"%!&|<>^` taken out for it. **Why deferred:**
  the other arguments are chatq's own - a session id, a mode, the tool's
  data folder - apart from `chatq -Model`, which you type yourself.
  **To close:** in `ConvertTo-ChatqArgLine`, quote any argument holding
  `&|<>^()` when the executable is a `.cmd` or `.bat`, and refuse one
  holding `"` or `%`.

## The console in the panel's place: what 0.7.2 left out

- **Maximize, and a place of its own.** The console had a title bar and
  kept where it was and whether it was maximized. As the panel's mode it
  has neither: no maximize button, and each time it grows from the panel's
  corner ([Get-ChatConsolePlacement](src/console.ps1)). An older
  `console-state.json`'s `x`, `y` and `max` are dropped as it is read
  ([Read-ChatConsoleState](src/console.ps1)). **Why deferred:** "in the
  panel's place" was the ask, and a place of its own would undo it; a
  maximized console would also have to be put back to its size before the
  panel's can be, which
  [Exit-ChatOverlayConsoleMode](src/overlay-windows.ps1) does by setting
  the state to normal first. **To close:** a maximize button in the
  header beside **← Panel** that flips `WindowState`, kept in
  `console-state.json` as `max` again and applied at the end of
  [Enter-ChatOverlayConsoleMode](src/overlay-windows.ps1).
- **Resizing from every edge.** Only the grip at its bottom-right corner
  resizes it. **Why deferred:** the panel's window is see-through and has
  no frame (`AllowsTransparency`, `WindowStyle` None), which WPF cannot
  change once the window exists, so there is no border for Windows to
  size it by; the grip was enough to size it. **To close:** a
  `WindowChrome` with a `ResizeBorderThickness` set as the console mode
  starts and cleared as it ends, or a hit test of our own answering
  `WM_NCHITTEST` near the edges.
- **Its size kept in pixels.** [Save-ChatConsoleDraft](src/console.ps1)
  keeps the window's size in screen pixels, so a console sized on a 150%
  monitor opens on a 100% one at the same pixels, holding half as much
  again. Only the first-time 980 x 680 and the window's least size
  (640 x 420 units, which the window enforces) go by the screen's scale:
  [Enter-ChatOverlayConsoleMode](src/overlay-windows.ps1) turns that least
  into the panel's screen's pixels and
  [Get-ChatConsolePlacement](src/console.ps1) raises a smaller saved size
  to it before holding the right edge, or Windows would enlarge the window
  from its left edge, past the panel's corner. **Why deferred:** one
  monitor here; with the least raised, the placement is all in the one
  screen's pixels and held to its working area, so a size kept in pixels
  only holds more or less, never lands off the screen. **To close:**
  keep `w` and `h` in units - divided by the scale
  ([Get-ChatOverlayScale](src/overlay-windows.ps1)) as they are saved,
  multiplied by the panel's screen's as it opens - and check it with S33
  item 33.
- **The fallback for an older `ChatOverlayNative`.** A process that loaded
  an older copy of the script keeps its type, which has no
  `ApplyInteractiveStyle` or `DropTopmost`;
  [Initialize-ChatOverlayNative](src/overlay-windows.ps1) then compiles the
  same code again as `ChatOverlayNativeNext`, and the console's mode calls
  through that. **Why deferred:** no test loads the older type first -
  every test child starts from a fresh process - and the overlay itself
  always does too, its restart on an update included
  ([Start-ChatOverlayProcess](src/overlay.ps1)). **To close:** an STA
  child that `Add-Type`s a `ChatOverlayNative` without those two methods
  before dot-sourcing the script, then opens the console and reads its
  styles.

## A VS Code front end

**Why deferred:** the terminal UI was chosen, and then the overlay's console.

**To close:** grow `extension/`, which already offers the reload after a
delete or an archive, shows a queued run's chat fresh in the window that
holds it, and since 0.7.2 has a chat picker, **Chat Manager: Open chat...**
([openChat](extension/extension.js)). What is left is a status-bar count of
queued jobs and the next send time. The picker reads the transcripts
itself rather than the index `chatfind` uses: see "Recent and the picker
read the transcripts, not the index" below.

## The extension's signal file holds one request

**Why deferred:** `data/reload-request` is one file, and the extension polls it
every 2 seconds. Two requests inside one poll - a delete right after a queued
run, say - and the first is overwritten unseen. Rare, and the cost is one
missed button. Since 0.6.0 the overlay's open chip writes a file of its own,
`data/open-request`, so a click and a run never overwrite each other; the one
slot remains within each file.

**To close:** make it a short array with ids, and have the extension keep the
last few ids it has seen instead of one.

## Background shells and "safe to reload"

**Why deferred:** the reload check counts workflows and background agents a
chat started that have not reported back, but not a Bash command run in the
background (`backgroundTaskId`). One is as often a dev server or a watcher as a
build, and a server never reports. Counting them would hold the project
"active" for as long as it runs, and `-WaitForIdle` would never return. A
reload still kills a background build with the chat's process. So, since
0.6.0, does showing a chat fresh after a run or through Show it:
`Stop-ChatIdleProcess` ends the chat's idle process with `taskkill /T`, dev
servers and all. Nothing warns. The open chip no longer ends anything.

**To close:** tell the two apart. A shell the model started with a timeout, or
one that moved to the background after its timeout ran out (`timedOutAfterMs`
in its result), is meant to end, so it could count. One started with
`run_in_background` and no end in sight would not. Before relying on that,
check the CLI keeps those fields stable. For the ending itself, a chat's
process with child processes other than its MCP servers could count as
`held` - once MCP servers can be told from shells the model started.

## Deletes and new chats through Reload Webviews

**Shelved** with Reload Webviews itself. 0.6.0 showed a queued run's chat
with it; on 2026-09-25 it left two views each resuming one chat with a
process of its own, and since 0.7.2 a queued run's chat opens in a tab
instead (CHANGELOG, 0.7.2). The notes below stay for if it is wanted again.

**Why deferred:** a delete, an archive and a new chat still reload the whole
window. Nothing has shown that Reload Webviews rebuilds the chat history -
it might keep a deleted chat listed - and the processes it restarts might
write a deleted chat back as a stub.

**To close:** S30 item 17 in TESTING.md, and a way round the second view
above. If the history drops a deleted chat with no stub written back, and
`claude-vscode.editor.open` shows a chat the list does not have yet, move
`deleted`, `archived` and `new` requests over.

## A busy judgement per window

**Why deferred:** chatq judges a folder, not a window, so a queued run's chat
is shown without asking only in a window on exactly that one folder. A
multi-root window, or one on a parent folder, always asks, and the overlay's
chip does not bring such a window forward (`Test-ChatWindowExact` guesses at
it from window titles).

**To close:** `hostPids` already names the `Code.exe` behind each window's
Claude processes (S30 item 12 checks it is the extension host). Judge busy
over the chats whose process has that parent, and any window where none of
its own chats is working can show the chat unasked, whatever its folders.

## Ending a chat's process off Windows

**Why deferred:** the parent check that tells a VS Code window's `claude`
from a terminal's reads the parent through CIM, which is Windows only. Off
Windows the process is never ended (`kept`), and the window is offered a
reload instead.

**To close:** a spike on macOS and Linux for what a panel `claude`'s parent
is called there (`Code Helper (Plugin)` on macOS, most likely), then a parent
lookup through `ps -o ppid=,comm=`.

## `code -n` behaviour

**Why deferred:** the chip brings a window forward with `code -n <folder>`,
assumed to focus the window already on that folder and open none. Windows
may refuse a background process the foreground and only flash the taskbar
button.

**To close:** only if S30 item 8 shows a second window, or item 6 a flash
instead of a raise: record what happens, and which VS Code setting
(`window.openFoldersInNewWindow`) or other route changes it. Nothing that
moves the pointer, types, or calls a window API.

## A chat no process holds gets no request

**Why deferred:** a queued run writes a `ran` request only when a window's
process held the chat as the run began. A chat whose process had already
ended - by itself, or with its tab closed - can still be cached in a side
bar, which then shows it stale, and nothing tells that window. 0.5.0 was the
same. The overlay's chip is the way round it by hand: it opens such a chat
in a new tab, loaded from disk.

**To close:** write a `ran` request (`oldProcess` none) after any run into a
chat a window may cache - one whose transcript says `claude-vscode` - and
let the window decide; S33 item 2 in TESTING.md shows whether a tab then
loads it fresh.

## A chat in the side bar gets a second process as a tab

**Why deferred:** the chip opens a chat with the Claude Code extension's
`claude-vscode.primaryEditor.open`, which brings forward a tab that shows
the chat or makes a new one, and never looks at the side bar. A chat idle in
the side bar then runs in two places: two views, and two `claude` processes
on one session, each able to write to it. Nothing in the Claude Code
extension's commands (2.1.282) reaches the side bar's session - none
closes, reloads or lists a panel by session id - and
`claude-vscode.editor.open`, which does use the side bar, rewrites the
user's `claudeCode.preferredLocation` and may lock a new editor group. So
[openTab](extension/extension.js) opens no tab for a chat working in a
process of this window - or of any window, on a Mac, where `hostPids` is
empty - with no one tab of its title here, since the second process would
start mid-turn, and says so. Two tabs of one label count as none, and so
does one tab of a label another chat of its folder would carry
([labelShared](extension/extension.js)). For one idle there it opens the
tab and says the chat now runs in two places, and to close the side bar's
copy. After a run, [perform](extension/extension.js) says the side bar's
copy is stale once the new tab is up.

**To close:** a Claude Code command that shows a session where it already
is, or closes a panel by its session id. Short of that, ending the side
bar's process before the tab opens (the chip already judges it `live`)
would leave the side bar on a dead view instead; S30 item 5 in TESTING.md
says whether that is the better trade. A working chat of no title is
never opened, even when a tab of its own shows it, since no tab's label can
be told to be its; the chip opens it once the turn ends.

## A closing process reads as a working chat for 60 s

**Why deferred:** [Test-ChatIdle](src/chatrm.ps1) counts any transcript in
the folder written in the last `$script:ChatIdleSeconds` (60 s) as live, on
top of what `claude agents` says - for Codex that file time is all there
is. A `claude` process that is closing writes its metadata (cost-state) to
its transcript on the way out, so for a minute after a Claude tab is closed
the folder reads busy. A queued run that ends then asks instead of showing
the chat by itself. Only the chat the run wrote is left out (`-Except`).
The cost is one more question, never a lost answer.

**To close:** tell a closing write from a turn. Read the transcript's last
record, and leave out one that is only that metadata - its record type
read off a real transcript first - or one written after its process left
`~/.claude/sessions/`.

## Show it ends the old process before the tab is known

**Why deferred:** Show it's child ends the chat's idle process
([Show-ChatFresh](src/live-chats.ps1), `-Via button`), and only then does
the extension look for the chat's tab. A run while you are away ends it the
same way. If [showTab](extension/extension.js) cannot be certain of the
stale tab - a chat of no title, a label that matches neither form, a tab
that did not come forward - it leaves it and says to close it. Until then
that tab sits on a dead process, showing "Claude Code process exited with
code 1". Closing it and opening the chat again recovers it.

**To close:** close the tab first and end the process after. Closing an
editor panel ends its process gracefully (the Claude extension's code: end
of stdin, killed only if alive about 7 s later), so the extension could
close a tab it is certain of and have the script only judge, or end the
process itself once the tab is found. Either moves the ending across the
line between the script and the extension, which changes the request they
share.

## Two chats whose titles share 24 characters

**Why deferred:** [showTab](extension/extension.js) knows a Claude tab only
by its label, since no command lists panels by session id and a webview
tab carries only its `viewType`. Claude cuts a title over 25 characters to
its first 24 and `…`, so two chats that begin with the same 24 characters
carry the same label. Closing a tab ends that chat's process, so a label
that another open Claude tab shares, or that another chat of the folder
would carry, open or not ([labelShared](extension/extension.js)), is never
taken as sure: the stale tab is left, and you are told to close it
yourself. The cost is that step by hand, for the chats whose titles begin
alike.

**To close:** a session id on the tab, or a Claude Code command that reloads
a panel by session id.

## A chat whose label another chat has is refused until renamed

**Why deferred:** the same blind spot reaches the chip and the picker. A
working chat opens only through its one tab here, and
[openTab](extension/extension.js) and [acceptChat](extension/extension.js)
count that tab as the chat's only while
[labelShared](extension/extension.js) finds no other chat of the folder -
open or long closed - whose title gives the same label. So a chat working
in its own tab is refused as if it worked in the side bar, one idle there
asks **Open here too**, and Show it leaves its stale tab, for as long as
the two titles share their first 24 characters. Renaming either chat
clears it. The rule leans the safe way: taken for the chat's, a tab of
the other chat would let a second process start on a working chat, or
close the other chat's tab. It looks in every folder of the window and the
chat's own, and reads the newest 200 transcripts of each (`PICK_CAP`),
once each until they change - what the picker's first listing costs. It
runs in the show queue ([enqueue](extension/extension.js)), where a slow
read would hold up every open and Show it behind it, so the read has
`timing.labelBudget` (1.5 s): one not done by then answers shared, the
safe side, and logs it. So in a large folder a first check that runs out
of time refuses, or leaves a tab, that a finished one would not have; and
a chat older than a folder's newest 200 is never looked at.

**To close:** what closes the entry above - a session id on the tab.
Counting only the chats a live process holds would not do: a tab stays up
on a dead process once a run or Show it has ended the chat's process
("Show it ends the old process before the tab is known", above), so a chat
with no process can still own the tab of that label.

## The chip shows a tab as it is

**Why deferred:** the chip ends no process
([Show-ChatFresh](src/live-chats.ps1), `-Via chip`): ending the one under a
tab that still showed the chat is what left two views on a dead process
on 2026-09-25. So [openTab](extension/extension.js) only brings forward a
tab the chat has, on the process it has. A queued run that ended while that
process lived is not in the tab yet, and that process does not read the
transcript again: a message typed there goes on from before the run. The
run's own Show it closes the tab and opens it again; the chip does not.

**To close:** let the extension remember a `ran` request it offered Show it
for and has not acted on, and send an open for that chat down Show it's
way instead - the check ends the idle process, and
[showTab](extension/extension.js) closes and reopens the tab it is certain
of. Or have the chip's script compare the transcript's last write with
when the window's process started, and say `stale` in the request.

## Closing the overlay does not keep it closed

**Why deferred:** since the overlay starts by itself
([Start-ChatOverlayAuto](src/overlay.ps1)), × and `chatoverlay -Stop` close
it only until the next shell or VS Code window starts it again.
The one lasting off is the switch `overlay.autoStart` in `config.json`,
set by `chatoverlay -AutoStart off` or, with no terminal, by **Chat
Manager: Overlay: start by itself...** in VS Code's command palette
([overlayAutoStart](extension/extension.js)). One switch was what it took
to make the chip the way in first.

**To close:** remember a close made by hand - a mark in
`overlay-state.json` the auto start honours until the next sign-in or until
`chatoverlay` is typed - and say so as it closes.

## The unread dot lives in the overlay's memory

**Why deferred:** [Update-ChatOverlayUnread](src/overlay-data.ps1) marks a
chat as it goes from busy or waiting to idle, unless its window is in front
then ([Test-ChatOverlayInFront](src/overlay-data.ps1)), and only three
things clear it: an open from the chip that sent the window its request
([Update-ChatOverlayOpen](src/overlay-windows.ps1)), a new turn, and its
session ending. Reading the chat in VS Code later - its tab brought to the
front, its answer scrolled - clears nothing, since nothing outside the
window knows a tab was looked at. The marks are kept in memory alone, so a
restart clears every dot: marks read back from a file would mean turns
that ended while no overlay watched, which it cannot know. Windows only:
[Invoke-ChatOverlayCycle](src/overlay-data.ps1) skips the marking where
`WantUnread` is off, as it is on macOS, whose panel has no chip to clear a
dot and reads no window in front to spare a chat one.

- **In front is the whole program, not the tab.** The window in front is
  matched against the chat's process and up to five of its parents
  ([Get-ChatOverlayProcessChain](src/overlay-data.ps1)). One `Code.exe`
  owns every window of its VS Code, and one Windows Terminal every tab, so
  a turn that ends while another window of that VS Code, or another tab of
  that terminal, is in front gets no dot either. A terminal chat whose
  chain matches nothing - a host the walk stops short of - is marked, as
  before. So is one whose console Windows handed off to Windows Terminal
  (its default-terminal setting): the shell's parent is Explorer, or what
  started it, never the `WindowsTerminal.exe` that draws it, so its chain
  never meets the window in front. The parents come from one
  `Win32_Process` snapshot a pass
  ([Get-ChatProcessTable](src/overlay-data.ps1)), taken only when a chat
  has just finished and its chain is not known yet, on the panel's
  thread; a snapshot over 250 ms is logged. Chains are kept for as long
  as the process lives. **To close:** the tab, not the program - only the
  extension knows which Claude tab is in front, as the bullet below needs
  anyway; for a handed-off console, the Windows Terminal that holds it,
  found some other way than the parents; and the snapshot taken off the
  panel's thread, as the console reads the chat index in a runspace of
  its own.
- **The chip clears on its child's word.** The dot goes when the chip's
  child exits 0, 25, 40 or 41: the open request was written for the
  window, whether or not `code` then brought it forward. Not on 10, a chat
  at work, which the window may refuse. The window may still refuse the
  others - a chat that began to work in its side bar meanwhile is not
  opened - and the dot is gone all the same. **To close:** let the
  extension say what was seen. On `window.tabGroups.onDidChangeTabs`, a
  Claude tab that comes to the front and is surely one chat's
  ([oneTabOf](extension/extension.js)) writes that session id to a file in
  `data/`, and the collector clears the dot for it; the chip's own clear
  then waits on the window's `open` outcome in that file too.

## Recent and the picker read the transcripts, not the index

**Why deferred:** the overlay's Recent list
([Update-ChatOverlayRecent](src/overlay-data.ps1),
[Read-ChatOverlayRecentItem](src/overlay-data.ps1)) and the extension's
picker ([listChats](extension/extension.js),
[readChat](extension/extension.js)) list and title the transcripts
themselves: each has to be fast on its own, and the picker runs in node,
with no PowerShell to ask. The chat index `chatfind` and `chatrm` use
(`data/chat-index.csv`, the Claude provider's `Describe` in
[src/providers.ps1](src/providers.ps1)) is built on its own schedule by
other rules. It looks for a rename and Claude's title at both ends of a
transcript and takes Claude's title over the sidecar's rename, where the
two readers take the sidecar first and look only in the last 256 KB. So a
large chat renamed early, or one renamed only in the panel, can read one
title in Recent or the picker and another in `chatfind`, and a chat can be
listed in one before the other.

**To close:** one reader. Keep in the index what both need - the title by
the Claude panel's order, the side and empty flags, the folder and the
write time - and have Recent read the index, synced as it goes; the picker
reads `chat-index.csv` too, or the same rules ported to node, head and tail
alike. Until then, a change to one reader's title rules goes to the others.

## The picker cannot tell which window holds a live chat

**Why deferred:** the Claude registry (`~/.claude/sessions/<pid>.json`)
says a panel holds a chat, not which VS Code window it is in, and
[acceptChat](extension/extension.js) has only the labels of this window's
tabs to go on. So a chat open and idle in another window reads the same as
one in this window's side bar - both ask **Open here too** - and one
working in another window is refused where it could be brought forward
there. A chat of no title never counts as in a tab here, since every such
tab reads "Claude Code", so it always asks, and neither does one whose
label another chat of its folder has ("A chat whose label another chat has
is refused until renamed", above). The overlay's chip knows the window
from the process's parent (`hostPids`); the picker reads no process tree.

**To close:** the parent pid of each live entry's `pid` - the extension
host, as `hostPids` names it (S30 item 12) - compared with this
extension's `process.pid`: this window's side bar, another window, or a
terminal. Another window's chat could then be handed to that window
through `data/open-request`, as the chip does.

## The picker's own reads

- **Titles only from the tail.** [readChat](extension/extension.js) looks
  for a rename and Claude's title in the last 256 KB. **Why deferred:**
  that was the spec, and a transcript's newest title is at its end; one
  written only near the start of a large file is rare. **To close:** look
  in the head's 256 KB as well when the tail has neither, as the index
  does.
- **A stale registry entry.** [entryLive](extension/extension.js) takes an
  entry as live when its pid answers and its `startedAt` is neither ahead
  of now nor from before the machine last started (60 s of slack). A pid
  handed on since boot to another process still reads live. **Why
  deferred:** the process's own start time needs a platform call per pid;
  the overlay's collector does it, in PowerShell. **To close:** compare
  `procStart` with the process's start time where node can read it, as
  [Test-ChatqSessionAlive](src/live-chats.ps1) does.

## A `claude -p` that is not chatq's

**Why deferred:** since 0.6.0 a chat's background work is told apart by
the `entrypoint` its records carry, and a print-mode run's (`sdk-cli`) is
taken for dead once no print-mode process of the chat is alive
(`Test-ChatPrintLive`, `Get-ChatBackgroundTasks -SkipPrint`). A queued run
is also known from the queue. Someone else's `claude -p --resume` into the
same chat is known only from `~/.claude/sessions/` - and whether a
print-mode process writes a file there, and with what `kind`, has not been
watched. If it writes none, such a run going on is invisible: its workflows
would read as dead, and Show it could end the window's process beside it.
The picker's **a queued prompt running** state
([chatState](extension/extension.js)) reads the same `kind`, so such a
run would show there as whatever else holds the chat, or as closed.

**To close:** S30 item 18. If a print-mode process leaves no registry file,
treat an `sdk-cli` record written in the last few minutes as a run still
going on.

## The overlay: what 0.4.0 left out

- **Codex and Copilot chats as live rows.** **Why deferred:** only Claude Code
  writes a list of what runs (`~/.claude/sessions/`). Codex's panel keeps a
  rollout open while a thread is shown, and Copilot records nothing at all.
  **To close:** for Codex, ask the shared app-server daemon for its threads
  (the one `codex queue` talks to; see the Codex entry above), or treat a
  rollout written in the last minute as working. Copilot waits on something
  that says a chat is running.
- **Linux.** **Why deferred:** nothing here runs Linux (see CI below), and each
  desktop has its own tray. **To close:** a GTK or tray-icon renderer reading
  the same `overlay.json`. `chatoverlay -Print` is the view until then.
- **Full screen.** **Why deferred:** a game in exclusive full screen draws
  over any window, and that is expected. **To close:** hide the panel while
  `SHQueryUserNotificationState` says full screen or presentation mode.
- **The macOS panel has never run.** **Why deferred:** no Mac here. **To
  close:** checklist S24 in TESTING.md, and `osacompile` on a `macos-latest`
  CI leg.
- **A hotkey on macOS.** **Why deferred:** a global key needs Carbon's
  `RegisterEventHotKey` or an accessibility permission, neither reachable
  cleanly from JXA. **To close:** only if the menu bar item turns out not to
  be enough.
- **The panel's buttons on macOS.** Windows has a row of buttons on the
  panel's top edge when the pointer is near it: grip, resize, collapse,
  refresh, console, settings, hide, close. The Mac panel has only its menu
  bar item, and `-Theme`, `-Opacity`, `-Width`, `-Rows` and `-Refresh` from
  a shell; it has no collapsed view. **Why deferred:** the
  Mac panel has never run, and more untested Cocoa would not help that.
  **To close:** after S24, a second small `NSPanel` beside the first, the
  way Windows uses a second window, shown from a tracking area on the panel;
  the settings and collapse as menu items, which JXA can already make.
- **Recent on macOS.** The Mac panel has no Recent list, since it has no
  open chip to open one with, and its collector
  ([Start-ChatOverlayMacHost](src/overlay-mac.ps1)) sets `WantRecent` off,
  so the listing costs nothing there; `chatoverlay -Print` still lists
  Recent. **Why deferred:** as the buttons above. **To close:** after S24,
  draw it under the rows as Windows does, and turn `WantRecent` back on.
- **Recent redrawn only on the next pass.** The settings box's Recent
  chips save at once ([Set-ChatOverlayRecentChoice](src/overlay-windows.ps1)),
  but the list changes up to two seconds later. **Why deferred:** building
  it lists every project's transcripts, which on the window's thread would
  stall the panel. **To close:** only if the wait shows: have the collector
  run its pass as soon as the setting is saved, as a refresh asks for usage.
- **Copilot usage without the GitHub CLI.** Copilot's line needs `gh`,
  logged in. **Why deferred:** VS Code writes only the plan to disk
  (`chat.setupContext` in `globalStorage/state.vscdb`, e.g.
  `free_limited_copilot`), never the quota; the figures come from GitHub
  with VS Code's GitHub login, which sits encrypted in VS Code's own secret
  store - not something another program should pry out. **To close:** if VS
  Code starts keeping the quota snapshot in its state, read it there.
- **Codex usage on demand.** Codex's figure is the `rate_limits` snapshot
  Codex writes into its own rollout during a run, so the refresh button
  cannot move it: it is as old as Codex's last run, and the panel says so.
  **Why deferred:** a fresh figure means asking OpenAI with the login Codex
  saved in `~/.codex/auth.json`, through an endpoint that is not documented
  and has not been looked into here. **To close:** find what Codex's own
  `/status` asks, and treat that token as the Claude one is treated - read
  for the one request, never stored, logged or refreshed - with the same
  waits on a refusal.
- **Usage without asking the endpoint.** Claude Code hands a status-line
  command `rate_limits.five_hour` / `seven_day` (`used_percentage`,
  `resets_at`) after every reply (code.claude.com/docs/en/statusline). That
  is current to the turn and costs no request, where the endpoint refuses
  when asked often. **Why deferred:** it means adding a command to
  `~/.claude/settings.json` - or wrapping one already there - and status
  lines are reported not to run in the VS Code extension's chat panel, which
  is where these chats live. **To close:** confirm whether the extension runs
  `statusLine`; if it does, an opt-in `chatoverlay -StatusLine on` that
  installs a one-line command writing `data/usage-statusline.json`, read by
  the collector ahead of the endpoint, and taken out again on `off` and on
  uninstall.
- **Naming a command while it runs.** While `/compact` runs, the row says only
  that a command is running. **Why deferred:** Claude Code writes the command
  down once it ends; until then its transcript holds a queue record with no
  text, and nothing else on disk names it. **To close:** if a later Claude
  Code puts the text in that record, or in `~/.claude/sessions/<pid>.json`,
  read it there.
- **More than one Claude account.** **Why deferred:** the overlay reads the
  one config dir it was started with (`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`). **To close:** an
  `overlay.claudeHomes` list, a row group and a usage line per account.
- **The collector on a thread of its own.** **Why deferred:** a pass costs
  40-60 ms and the usage request never blocks, so the panel has not stuttered.
  **To close:** only if `data/logs/overlay.log` or use shows it does: a
  background runspace for the collector, handing snapshots to the UI thread.

## Copilot Chat

**Why deferred:** there is no CLI that resumes a Copilot chat headless. chatrm
can find Copilot chats, but nothing could deliver a prompt to one.

**To close:** a headless resume path from GitHub.

## Start at boot

**Why deferred:** nothing is registered with the OS, on purpose. After a reboot
the watcher returns with the next shell.

**To close:** an opt-in `chatinstall -AtLogon` that writes a Task Scheduler /
launchd / systemd user entry and removes it again on uninstall.

## CI on macOS and Linux

**Why deferred:** CI now runs the self-test on Windows under both 5.1 and
PowerShell 7. The Unix branches - `nohup`, `caffeinate`, `systemd-inhibit`,
`chmod 600`, `osascript` and `notify-send` toasts, `ioreg` idle time,
`Process.Kill($true)` - are written but have never run.

**To close:** add `ubuntu-latest` and `macos-latest` to the matrix. The tests
need a `fake-claude` shell wrapper next to the `.cmd` one, and the few
Windows-only checks (DPAPI, the echo exe) a skip on Unix.

## Codex threads archived from Codex's own panel

**Why deferred:** `chatrestore` lists what `chatrm -Archive` archived, from its
own records, plus any rollout under `~/.codex/archived_sessions/` - which spike
S16 showed is where `codex archive` moves one. Whether Codex's panel archives
the same way, rather than only in its sqlite state, has not been watched.
`chatrestore <id>` hands any id to `codex unarchive` either way.

**To close:** archive a throwaway thread from the Codex panel and look for it
under `archived_sessions/`. If it is not there, read the thread list from
Codex's app-server instead.

## Sponsorship

**Why deferred:** there is no sponsor account yet. The README carries a grey
`sponsor · coming soon` badge pointing here. There is deliberately no
`.github/FUNDING.yml` - with a placeholder handle GitHub's own Sponsor button
would open a 404.

The options:

| | fits | costs |
|---|---|---|
| GitHub Sponsors | the button sits in the repo header, one-off or monthly | enrolment and payout setup; no fee on personal accounts |
| Ko-fi | one-off tips, a simple page | no fee on tips; memberships take a cut |
| Buy Me a Coffee | one-off tips, memberships | a 5% fee |
| Patreon | monthly memberships | a platform fee; heavy for a one-file tool |
| thanks.dev | sponsors a project's dependencies at once | little to gain for a tool nobody depends on yet |

**To close:** pick one, add `.github/FUNDING.yml` with its handle, and swap the
badge for the real link.

## Social preview image

**Why deferred:** GitHub sets a repo's social preview only in the web UI
(Settings → Social preview); there is no API for it.

**To close:** upload a 1280×640 image made from `docs/demo-list.svg`.

## Weekly-limit and model-scoped limit handling

**Why deferred:** every limit seen on this machine was `five_hour`.
- A model-scoped limit (`seven_day_opus`, a `weekly_scoped` cache entry) no
  longer blocks the queue. The probe, asked with each chat's own model, decides.
- A job waiting on a real weekly limit just waits, without holding the machine
  awake.

**To close:** capture a real `seven_day` / `seven_day_opus` rejection. Check
the exact `rateLimitType` names against the list in `$script:ChatqWideLimits`.
Then decide whether a job should wait days, or alert and park.

## Overloads on Codex

**Why deferred:** the 529 handling watches status.claude.com, which covers
Claude only. A dropped Codex connection ("stream disconnected", "error sending
request") is retried like Claude's, but a Codex server error worded any other
way still fails the job.

**To close:** capture a real Codex 5xx/overload event. Then either watch
status.openai.com the same way, or just retry with the same backoff.
